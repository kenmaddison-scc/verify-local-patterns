            <h3 class="heading-medium">Memory card</h3>
            <p>
              A memory card is a small plastic card used as removable storage for your photos. Your camera automatically saves your photos to your memory card.
            </p>
            <p>
              Take the memory card out of your camera and insert it into your computer. Your photos are now on your computer.
            </p>

            <h3 class="heading-medium">Transfer cable</h3>
            <p>
              A transfer cable is a lead which can connect your camera to your computer. When it's connected, your computer will start transferring your photos to your computer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Insert one end of the cable into your camera and the other into your computer to begin the transfer.
            </p>

            <h3 class="heading-medium">Wifi or bluetooth</h3>
            <p>
              If your camera has wifi or bluetooth functionality, it should have a wifi or bluetooth icon. If your computer also has wifi or bluetooth you can move your photos from your camera to your computer without physically connecting the 2 devices.
            </p>
            <p>
              Look at your camera instructions to find out how wifi and bluetooth work for your camera.
