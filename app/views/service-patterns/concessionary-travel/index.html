                  GOV.UK Verify will send your service the user's address, as supplied by the user's chosen identity provider. When the user returns from the GOV.UK Verify process, your service webpage should ask them to confirm if this is their current address.

                <p>
                  If the travel pass is physical, your service will get extra confidence in the address by mailing the pass to the address the user provided. Mention that your service will be using the address they've given for this purpose on the service confirmation page.

                When the user has uploaded their photograph, your service should tell them their application is complete, state when they can expect to receive their bus pass and let them know it will be posted to the address they previously confirmed.

                Your service should send a letter with the pass providing information on how, when and where it can be used, and what to do in case of a lost or stolen pass.

                Bus passes are a physical plastic card that successful applicants can use on any bus in England. They need to either show it to the driver or scan on a card reader when they get onto the bus.

                In London, the pass is an Oyster card which the user scans on a card reader.

                To reduce the possibility of fraud, bus passes need to have expiry dates no more than 5 years from the date of issue. (Specification 1.31 from the
                <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/3621/travelconcession.pdf">Department for Transport guidance</a>.)

              <p>
                Your service should send a notification to the user through their preferred communication channel – email, text message or by post – when their bus pass is about to expire.
