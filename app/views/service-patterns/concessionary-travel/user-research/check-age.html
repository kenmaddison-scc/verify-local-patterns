      <p>The goal for user research during this phase of the project, as outlined in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual">service manual</a>, was to find out:</p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>who our users are</li>
        <li>our users’ needs and how they are currently meeting them</li>
        <li>needs that are not meeting</li>
      </ul>
<p>Achieving this in the relatively short timescales of our discovery, and at sufficient scale, across all participating councils presented a challenge, especially given that most participating councils had never conducted user research for project discovery.</p>

<p>To achieve scale quickly, we provided training for all of the participating councils early in the discovery phase of the project. By sharing the research effort across the participating councils, we were able to conduct approximately 50 interviews with existing service users.</p>
      
<h2 class="heading-medium">What we learnt about applying for a concessionary travel pass</h2>

<p>The user journey that we observed and associated needs are recorded on the <a href="/public/images/concessionary-travel-journey-map.pdf">concessionary travel user journey map</a> (PDF, 70Kb).</p>

<p>Most notable of our findings was the low levels of confidence and online skills of these service users. This presents a number of potential issues in terms of the usability of the service, as well as in concerns about privacy and security of digital services.</p>

<p>A very large proportion of those we spoke to were either unwilling or unable to complete the application process unaided and needed to get help from a friend or family member. It is worth noting that those assisting were also often unable to complete online transactions that required them to scan documents or upload photos.</p>

 <h3 class="heading-small">Initial awareness:</h3>
<p>Most were aware that they would be eligible for some form of concessionary travel, however it was important for them to be able to check and get official confirmation of this before applying.</p>

<p>Some applied when they reached ‘the age’ and considered it a milestone in their life that they wanted to recognise. Others only applied when a circumstance changed which led to increased dependence on public transport.</p>

      </details>


 <h3 class="heading-small">Discovery and application process:</h3>
<p>From the outset, a significant proportion of those we spoke to needed assistance with the process. This was especially so where the application process had to be completed online. In most cases, this was provided by a family member or carer.</p>

<p>Very significant concerns were raised by this much older group about the difficulty and security of completing an application online. Most were unwilling to do so, preferring to visit a contact centre or apply by post.</p>

<p>The most common cause of issues in completing the application process was the need to provide documents to prove identity and eligibility. This problem was most significant in digital applications, with many unable to complete without assistance.</p>

 <h3 class="heading-small">Processing and fulfilment: </h3>
<p>Once applications had been submitted users needed to know that they were being processed, as well as when they would be issued.</p>

<p>These users also tended to be less confident about their applications, and there was a greater need to know that they had completed the application correctly.</p>

            <li>to know what’s happening with my application, so that I don’t have to call up to find out when I’ll get it</li>
            <li>to get my bus pass quickly, so that I’m able to travel</li>
            <li>to know where and how I can use my pass, so I don’t get thrown off a bus</li>
          </ul>
      </details>

 <h3 class="heading-small">Renewal: </h3>
<p>Some users were concerned they would forget their renewal, so wanted to be reminded when the date was due. In most cases, when it came to renewing, users were disappointed to have to complete another full application, as they thought their information would have been saved.</p>

            <li>you to remember who I am, so that I don’t have to apply again every year</li>
